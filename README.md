SEMAPHORE is an LED art installation located in [Coda's](https://www.coda.io) San Francisco office. It consists of 14 repurposed LED tubes controlled via custom software that generates organic shapes and patterns. The installation can be interacted with remotely via [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com) and suitable endpoints.
